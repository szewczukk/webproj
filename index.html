                <strong>John Ernst Steinbeck</strong> (/ˈstaɪnbɛk/; February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an
                American writer. He won
                the
                1962 Nobel Prize in Literature "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do
                sympathetic
                humor and keen social perception". He has been called "a giant of American letters."

        <p>
            During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts,
            including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the
            comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic East of Eden (1952), and
            the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath
            (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75
            years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.

                <p>
                    East of Eden brings to life the intricate details of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, and
                    their interwoven stories. The Hamilton family in the novel is said to be based on the real-life
                    family of Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's maternal grandfather.
